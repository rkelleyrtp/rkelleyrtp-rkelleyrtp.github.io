<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I am <strong>Ron Kelley</strong> - Team Leader, Mentor, Infrastructure Architect, and hard-core Technology Nerd.</p>
<p>My passion lies in the entire infrastructure stack - from hardware, to software, to firmware.  I love building out high-performance compute environments ranging from single-host virtualization servers to multi-rack configurations that span multiple networks, compute farms, and storage systems.  A self-starter by nature, I enjoy deploying virtualization clusters, installing Linux via PXE, configuring IPSec tunnels on pfSense firewalls, setting up haproxy and nginx app stacks, configuring LXD containers, and lots of other cool stuff.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I have been very fortunate to work with some of the best technologies in our industry including Cisco switches and blade servers, NetApp storage systems, VCE VxFlex vBlocks, Dell/EMC PowerFlex systems, and even a little bit of AWS/GKE/Azure sprinkled in.  As a jack-of-all-trades, I can work on just about any technology in the data center space.  You name it - I&rsquo;ve probably had my hands on it!</p>
<p>I currently work for Dell/EMC as a Principal Architect on the <a href="https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/storage/powerflex.htm">PowerFlex</a> engineering team.  My team and I architect and implement customer-driven solutions based on our PowerFlex software defined storage platform for on-prem and cloud based deployments.  When I am not busy researching new technologies, I am either fishing in my kayak, working in our community garden, growing hydroponic veggies, or walking my Aussie dog, &ldquo;Berkeley&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by.  These pages are dedicated to: me!  They are a reminder of the many cool things I have stumbled upon over the years.  Hopefully, they help you as well.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="my-background">My Background</h2>
<p>My IT journey started many years ago while serving as a Staff Sergeant in the United States Air Force.  Back then, I was a software tester for the Contingency Theater Automated Planning System <a href="https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/equip/ctaps.htm">(CTAPS)</a> system based on Sun Solaris.  From there, I transitioned into a civilian role supporting the same system - this time as a contractor.</p>
<p>Moving on from a DoD role,  I spent the next 12 years at <a href="www.cisco.com">Cisco Systems</a> working on various technologies including routers, switches, fiber-channel SAN, network management products, and radio-access-network products.  Back them, working at Cisco was a huge deal.  Getting exposed to so many technologies was like drinking from a firehose.  I was fortunate to spend time working on lots of different teams with some very smart people.</p>
<p>Looking to expand my leadership skills and work in the storage space, I joined <a href="https://www.netapp.com">Network Appliance</a> (NetApp) as a manager of the Customer Proof of Concept (CPOC) center.  My team and I architected, built, and help drive solutions for some of NetApp&rsquo;s most demanding customers based on Cisco&rsquo;s HyperFlex infrastructure - a combination of Cisco networking, Cisco blade servers, and NetApp storage systems.</p>
<p>A geek at heart, I was instantly hooked on HyperConverged infrastructure.  From NetApp, I moved over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCE_(company)">VCE</a>, a joint venture based on VMware, Cisco, EMC, and Intel.  VCE&rsquo;s claim to fame was their vBlock HCI infrastructure.  They offered turn-key infrastructure racks that combined networking, storage, compute, and virtualization into a single deployable unit shipped from factory.  They are deployed in either simple, single-rack configurations or large, multi-rack build-outs.  Just plum &lsquo;em in, and they are ready to go!  Shortly after EMC bought controlling interest in VCE, Dell decided it wanted more of the infrastructure space and subsequently bought EMC back in 2018.  Thus, I landed my current &ldquo;gig&rdquo; at Dell via multiple acquisitions (VCE &ndash;&gt; EMC &ndash;&gt; Dell).</p>
<p>During this time, I also helped launch a real-estate startup company from California, <a href="https://www.homejunction.com">HomeJunction</a>.  As an infrastructure engineer, my job was to bild out their entire data center footprint (multi rack, multi-blade chassis, 10GbE Networking, virtualization, etc - the whole thing).  HomeJunction specialized in &ldquo;lifestyle searching&rdquo; in the real-estate market.  The company was founded around 2007 (when I got involved) and was recently acquired by <a href="https://www.attomdata.com">AttomData</a>.  Working for HomeJunction was perhaps the best time in my professional career as I was expected to know how to run an entire data center deployment - from hardware, to software, to firmware.  Not to mention all the software running under the covers (NFS, DNS, firewalls, nginx, LXD containers, etc).</p>
<p>Around 2013 I also managed to help start a data center hosting business here in Raleigh, NC called <a href="https://grassroutesnetworking.com">Grassroutes Networking</a>.  My buddy and I found some early-stage startup companies that needed both hosting and IT consulting services.  The business was a huge success - growing 100% YoY in the first couple of years.  Unfortunately, I could not spend as much time as I wanted due to the day-job responsibilities and had to ultimately hand the business over to my partner.</p>

<h2 id="where-am-i-going">Where am I going?</h2>
<p>My professional goal is to truely be a jack-of-all-trades.  This broad experience  gives you the best opportunity to architect, install, and debug just about any IT project.  The next gig will probably be in the content delivery network (CDN) space.  I am hoping to stretch my skills in network layers 4-7 as well as challenge me to build out larger, more highly-available networks.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
